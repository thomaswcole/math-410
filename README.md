# MATH410: Majors Research Project

I completed this research project under the supervision of Dr. Russell Steele at McGill University for MATH410. In this project, we examine the use of PCA as
a method of dimensionality reduction for the implied volatility surface. We also perform a simulation study to examine different methods of selecting principal components to retain.

Code is available upon request.
